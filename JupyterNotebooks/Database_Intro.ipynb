More than just a file, databases are managed by their own software, and often that software runs on a server.\n",

    "Why use a server? For one, as databases grow, their files grow. Also more compute power is needed to quickly access that data. So, for larger databases, larger computers, typically servers are needed--*this can also scale to clusters of computers*. Also, larger databases tend to be used by more than one person at a time. Server-based databases are typically setup with a **client-server model**, where the database is running on a server that users to not actively log into. Users connect to the server using the client. This allows the server to be dedicated to processing client queries and allows for the server to be setup to manage concurrent use from multiple users. If multiple users try to change the same file on a computer at the same time, file corruption can happen. Using the client-server model prevents this.  \n"
